webcrawler: A tool designed by Ian Kenten and Rawaz Rahim to pull the HTML and 
the images used by different pages of the old Ethical Simulator website. This 
website was no longer functioning and was located on the Wayback Machine (aka 
the Internet Archive) so the webcrawler is designed to pull the website from
there.
